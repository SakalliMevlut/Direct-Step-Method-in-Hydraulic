# Direct-Step-Method-in-Hydraulic
Direct Step calculation for trapezoidal and rectangular open channel in MAT-LAB.
In this MAT-LAB file, analysis can be made for 2 different unit systems, 2 different channel geometries and different resolution intervals.
An analysis is made by only asking you for information about the flow rate, manning n value, slope and channel geometry, and as a result, critical water depth, normal water depth, total length of the solution interval and a tabulated solution are presented.
You can also see information such as flow type and flow profile in the results of the analysis.
In the 'Step size' section of the code, you are asked to choose one of two values. If you choose the value of 0.5 here, it will proceed by dividing the solution interval into wider intervals, if you choose 0.25, the interval will be divided more often to increase the accuracy of the solution.
Since the code file works with the images given in the RAR file, the code file and the images must be in the same location. These images have been added to provide information about the information requested during the analysis and to show the type of flow.
