# Direct-Step-Method-in-Hydraulic
Direct Step calculation in trapezoidal and rectangular open channel 
In this file, analysis can be made for 2 different unit systems, 2 different channel geometries and different resolution intervals.
An analysis is made by only asking you for information about the flow rate, manning n value, slope and channel geometry, and as a result, critical water depth, normal water depth, total length of the solution interval and a tabulated solution are presented.
